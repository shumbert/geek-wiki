# Signal
## Notes
- Signal uses your existing phone number.  The number must be able to receive an SMS or phone call. 
- All Signal messages and calls will come from your registered Signal number. 
- A new install of Signal also generates a new safety number for each conversation thread with your contacts.
- Signal Desktop must be linked with either Signal Android or Signal iOS to send and receive messages.

## Backup
Signal on Android have a backup/restore feature. Nothing on iOS, messages are stored locally and cannot be transferred between devices.

## Safety numbers
- https://signal.org/blog/safety-number-updates/
- Safety numbers used to be per-user, they are now per-conversation.
- Before, signal required a manual approval process whenever safety numbers changed. Now you are still being notified however you are not blocked from sending/receiving new messages.

## Groups
- Signal servers do not possess any information about groups or your membership in them. Only another member of the group can refresh group info for your phone.
- If you re-install signal on your phone, you have to ask group members to send messages in the group or to update the group name or avatar. This should refresh group information on your device as well.
